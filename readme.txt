# To run the program, run the LinearRegressionMain.java with 2 arguments:

src/main/resources/input/training.csv src/main/resources/output

# When the program finishes running, the result contains the weights of linear regression model will be in the file:

src/main/java/model/parameter/weights.csv

# If you want to get the weights for linear regression model in the case of data normalization, you need to change the
argument
